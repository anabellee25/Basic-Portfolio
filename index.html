        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I was born to Chinese immigrants, Yip and Su, and was raised in Belize, a small
            Central American country neighboring Guatemala. Since I was a small child,
            I was taught how to speak several languages in order to communicate with
            those around me. I am grateful for the childhood that I had because I was
            surrounded by different cultures and learned to appreciate the different walks
            of life that people come from. At the age of 13, my family and I relocated to Brooklyn, NY where we lived
            for 3 years before making Washington our home.
        </p>

        <p>After working retail for 8 years, I joined the corporate role working in Sales Operations
            for a start up company specializing in developing telematics and software for fleet management.
            In my free time I enjoy being outdoors, hiking, finding every swimming hole that
            Washington has to offer and riding on the back of my husband's Harley,
            granted the weather is nice. I also enjoy spending quality time with my family and friends
            or staying in on rainy Washington nights and watching horror movies.
        </p>
